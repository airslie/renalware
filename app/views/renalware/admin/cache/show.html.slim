    h2 Application Cache
    p
      | The cache (backed by Redis) stores some queries and html fragments in order to make
      |  the rendering of pages faster and less resource intensive. Cached elements are invalidated
      |  when the underlying database data changes (but it only examines the updated_at column and
      |  count of records, in order to catch edits, inserts and deletions) or the html template
      |  changes (changes are only reflected after am app restart in this latter case).
    p
      | You can check the size and number of keys in the Redis cache by running&nbsp;
      code redis-cli --stat
    p There are certain cases where you might need to clear the cache:
    ol
      li
        | You have changed the underlying database data directly in SQL without also updating the
        |  updated_at column.

    h2 PDF Letter Cache
    p
      | The PDF letter cache stores generated PDFs so they do not need to be regenerated if
      |  unless their content has changed. It is a FileStore cache and the files are stored
      |  in&nbsp;
      code shared/tmp/pdf_letter_cache
      |  - though in a folder layout that a little tricky to navigate
      |  and search if you are looking for something; however it is NOT meant to be the canonical
      |  source for PDF letters, rather a volatile cache to aid performance. EPR should be the place
      |  to look for letter content - or just view the PDF through the UI.
    p
      | You may wish to clear the PDF Letter Cache if you notice any anomalies in the PDFs.
      |  Please raise a GitHub issue after clearing the cache so we can look into it.
