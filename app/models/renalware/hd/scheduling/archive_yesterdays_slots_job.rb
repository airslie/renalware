# A cron job creates this delayed job, which does the following:
# For all Weekly Diaries in the past, plus this week
# for each day that is in the past
# mark any slots in the weekly diary as archived
# and where the weekly diary is inheriting slots from the master diary
# create corresponding slots in the weekly diary (ie migrate thos slots from master to weekly)
# and archive them.
# No slots before the current day (or the up_until: arg) should be touched
#
#
# OK we have a problem,
# If last week there was no weekly diary created... then there is nothing to archive if eg today is
# Monday.
# So really whats the query for finding slots to archive?
# We need to really always inner join onto weekly diaries, and within those for their slots
# select unarchved onces in the past.
# So we MUST always have weekly diaries for every possible week and not rely om a user working the
# UI to create these JIT - because if they don't, unless we have a fn to create missing diaries,
# (from which date?) then we can't query
# So either
# - seed next 10 years (520 per unit)
# - have a fn to generate missing diaries - might be better and safer in the long run?
# - Otherwise after 5 or 10 years or whatever its bound to have caused a problem.
