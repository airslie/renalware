        # resulting in unique key violation.
        # Using a transaction here prevents any orphaned records if there is an error.
        # However we should be aware that any listeners raising an error will prevent successful
        # in all other listeners. So a listener should be careful to catch errors and not re-raise
        # them, or use the :message_processed message (lower down) which is safer.
