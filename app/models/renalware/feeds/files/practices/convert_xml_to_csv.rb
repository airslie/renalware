          # the memory footprint of the app does not rise which is the important thing here as the
          # HSCorg XML file is around 400MB. This because we have not loaded the
          # XML into memory (which would cause memory usage to spike over 1GB) but instead
          # are walking over the elements. Its slower than SAX which is an alternative, as we have
          # to inspect every Organisation in in the file even though we only want a subset of them,
          # but its very easy to read.
          # Currently takes around 3 minutes as a background job.
          # Be careful when handling elements that can appear in > 1 place - e.g. Status - and
          # check the @node.depth.

          # There are alternative ways to parse the XML. TRUD provide an XSLT style-sheet which can
          # extract orgs with a specific primary role (RO76 in our case) to build another XML
          # document; they provide another XSLT for parsing the XML into CSV files. However they
          # split the CSV files (a separate one for contact details for example), and do not not
          # run on Mac/Linux without modification (they expect to be run on Windows).

          # - CHANNEL ISLANDS (57)
          # - ISLE OF MAN (169)
