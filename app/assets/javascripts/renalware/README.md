# Javascript

The js or js.erb files in this top-level folder will be compiled and linked
by sprockets 4 as individually downloadble .js assets.

core.jd.erb is the main js file which imports other .js files in
./components and includes js assets from external gem dependencies.

See https://github.com/rails/sprockets#link_directory
