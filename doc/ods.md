# Synchronising Practices and GPS with the NHS Organisation Data Service (ODS)

GP and practice data are stored in these database tables:

```
patient_practices (practices/surgeries)
patient_primary_care_physicians (GPs)
patient_practice_memberships (which GP is at which practice)
```

When you deploy Renalware for the first time, it wonâ€™t have many (or any) practices and GPs in the these tables (the demo data if you have installed it has about 25 practices). However it will have set up a cron job that overnight fetches updates from the [NHS Organisation Data Service (ODS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/gp-and-gp-practice-related-data) api, so that the next day you will find there are 18,000+ practices (and even more GPs) in the the database.

If you have say a migration server which you turn off over night so the cron job does not run, or you want to just manually run the sync process, you can trigger it with:

```bash
cd ~/apps/renalware/current
bundle exec rake ods:sync
```

> This rake task kicks of a background job to do the actual work. If you have deployed Renalware
with capistrano then it will have started a background worker for you and there is nothing else to
do. If you are running locally in development mode you will need to start a worker with
`bundle exec rake jobs:work` (`or bundle exec rake app:jobs:work if you are developing the
renalware-core gem and not a host app)

## Implementation details

### Practices
These are synced using the [ODS API](https://directory.spineservices.nhs.uk/ORD/2-0-0/organisations?PrimaryRoleId=RO177).

### GPs and GP -> Practice memberships
These are imported by downloading the current CSV for each and passing the path to the CSV to
a corresponding Renalware SQL function which imports the data usin the Postgres `COPY` command.
**Note that currently if the PostreSQL database is on a different server (or another Docker
container) to the Renalware application code, `COPY` will fail (PG needs the file to be local to
the database server). There is an open issue to remove the use of `COPY` for this reason.**

## Migration notes

You will need to sync GPS and practices before migrating patient data across.
A patient has a `practice_id` and and `primary_care_physician_id`. These are foriegn keys into
`patient_pratices` and `patient_primary_care_physicians` tables.
If you have a patient that you know belongs to a pratice 'A81010', you will need to look up
that practice row in patient_practices and use its id as practice_id when inserting into
the patients table. Likewise for primary_care_physcian: if you have a GP code like 'G3141373'
 you will need to look that code the primary_care_physciansto get the id.

> **Letters** Note that letters are snail-mailed/emailed to the practice's address/email, not the GP's address.
Generally it seems that the GP name is less and less significant, and the important thing is to get
the practice right. If a GP moves away from the practice, letters will still be addressed to them
until the patient's GP is updated in Renalware, but this is not generally an issue.
