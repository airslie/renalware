Feature: Recording a patient rule

  A clinician adds a "free text" pathology request rule for a patient. The rule is used by the
  pathology request algorithm in order to require specific observations to be measured for an
  individual patient.

  Each patient rule includes a free text description of the test that is to be carried out which is
  the instruction that will be given to the pathology department once the request form is printed.
