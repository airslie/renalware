Feature: Determining observations required based on an observation result rule type

  A rule with rule_type "ObservationResult" makes a numerical comparison on a patient's observation_result with a given value.

  Scenario Outline:
    Given the global rule sets:
      | request_description_code     | BFF        |
      | clinic                       | Access     |
      | frequency_type               | Always     |
    And the rule set contains these rules:
      | type              | id  | operator   | value   |
      | ObservationResult | HGB | <operator> | <value> |
    And Patty is a patient
    And Patty has observed an HGB value of <result>
    When the global pathology algorithm is run for Patty in clinic Access
    Then it is determined the observation is <determination>

    Examples:
      | result   | operator | value    | determination |
      | 99       | <        | 100      | required      |
      | 100      | <        | 100      | not required  |
      | 99       | >        | 100      | not required  |
      | 100      | >        | 100      | not required  |
      | 99       | <=       | 100      | required      |
      | 100      | <=       | 100      | required      |
      | 99       | >=       | 100      | not required  |
      | 100      | >=       | 100      | required      |
      | positive | ==       | positive | required      |
      | negative | ==       | positive | not required  |
